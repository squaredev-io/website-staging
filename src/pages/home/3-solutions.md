# This markdown file will render a "cards" section, which contains a series of cards (3 for each row). If a heading
# is given it will not show the first card but the heading. The following properties may be set (properties with * are
# required, to leave a property blank use ''):
#
# template*: The page template to use, leave it "default" if not sure
# component*: The React component to use (here is "cards")
# heading: The text that appears in the upper left area of the section
# icon: The icon to accompany the heading
##
template: default
component: cards
heading: Our solutions
icon: lab-tube-bold-green.png
#
# HOW TO USE TEXT BELOW:
#
# Each H1 header (rows starting with #) becomes the card's headline
# Each H2 header (rows starting with ##) becomes the card's heading
# Each H3 header (rows starting with ###) becomes the card's icon
# Each H4 header (rows starting with ####) becomes the url to follow when clicking on a card
